Quantum computing is an emergent field of cutting-edge computer science harnessing the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. The field of quantum computing contains a range of disciplines, including quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that supercomputers can’t solve, or can’t solve fast enough. By taking advantage of quantum physics, fully realized quantum computers would be able to process massively complicated problems at orders of magnitude faster than modern machines. For a quantum computer, challenges that might take a classical computer thousands of years to complete might be reduced to a matter of minutes. The study of subatomic particles, also known as quantum mechanics, reveals unique and fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers harness these fundamental phenomena to compute probabilisticall

Quantum computing by Chris Woodford. Last updated: August 23, 2023. How can you get more and more out of less and less? The smaller computers get, the more powerful they seem to become: there's more number-crunching ability in a 21st-century cellphone than you'd have found in a room-sized, military computer 50 years ago. Yet, despite such amazing advances, there are still plenty of complex problems that are beyond the reach of even the world's most powerful computers—and there's no guarantee we'll ever be able to tackle them. One problem is that the basic switching and memory units of computers, known as transistors, are now approaching the point where they'll soon be as small as individual atoms. If we want computers that are smaller and more powerful than today's, we'll soon need to do our computing in a radically different way. Entering the realm of atoms opens up powerful new possibilities in the shape of quantum computing, with processors that could work millions of times faster t

Have you ever heard of a computer that can do things regular computers can’t? These special computers are called quantum computers. They are different from the computer you use at home or school because they use something called “qubits” instead of regular “bits”. A bit is like a light switch that can only be on or off, like a zero or a one. But a qubit can be both zero and one at the same time! This means quantum computers can do many things at once and work much faster than regular computers. It’s like having many helpers working on a task together instead of just one. Scientists first thought about quantum computers a long time ago, but it wasn’t until recently that they were able to build working models. Now, companies and researchers are working on making bigger and better quantum computers. Regular computers use bits, which are either ones or zeros, to process information. These bits are passed through logic gates, like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, that manipulate the data and produce
